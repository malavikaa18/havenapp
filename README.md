### Project Description
A smart safety platform designed to protect women in real time.
Featuring an SOS button, live location tracking, emergency contacts,
safe zone alerts, and community support, it ensures quick access to help when needed.
Built with Flutter and web integration, this project was developed during a hackathon 
to empower women and enhance safety.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Women should feel safe everywhere, but reality says otherwise. Walking alone at night, 
commuting, or even everyday situations can turn unsafe in seconds.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A smart safety app & website with an SOS button, live tracking, emergency contacts, 
and safe zone alertsâ€”built during a hackathon to provide real-time security and peace of mind.
Because safety shouldnâ€™t be a luxury.
